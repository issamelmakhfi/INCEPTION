## What is Docker ?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## How Docker work ?

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

## TO DO LIST âœ….
> In order to finish the project smoothly, I decided to partition the tasks to do one after the other.

Here's the divided tasks for the project.
- [ ] Introduction to docker.
- [x] [Create a Dockerfile to build the NGINX image and enabling SSL with openssl](#create-dockerfile-for-nginx-and-enable-ssl)
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile to build the WordPress image. Also install php-fpm within the same container.
- [ ] Create 2 volumes. One for the database, and the other for the files of our website.
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile to build MariaDB image.
- [ ] Create the `docker-compose.yml` file. Within it, make a network that establishes the connection between all the above containers.


# Let's get to work
## Create Dockerfile for NGINX and Enable SSL
As said before, we will be using `debian:stable` image as a base image for all our docker containers.
